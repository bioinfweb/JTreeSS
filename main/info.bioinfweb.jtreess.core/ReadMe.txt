JTreeSS main module
===================

In order to run this code in your own Eclipse Workspace you need to checkout additional dependency projects from the 
following SVN locations:

- <https://secure.bioinfweb.info/Code/svn/commons.java/trunk/main/info.bioinfweb.commons.core>

Furthermore ANTLR plugins for Eclipse are required to generate the classes in info.bioinfweb.jtreess.reader.parser. 
(Search the Eclipse Marketplace for "ANTLR".) Otherwise that package will be empty resulting in compile errors in 
other classes.

 * This interface needs to be implemented by applications that want to make use of <i>JTreeSS</i>. It contains methods to provide information
 * necessary to process a <i>TreeSS</i> document, e.g., on the tree topology, metadata values or size information.
 * <p>
 * The actual formatting of the tree is done by multiple calls of {@link #setNodeFormat(Object, String, RuntimeValue)}. Implementations of this
 * interface need to be passed to {@link TreeSSProcessor#applyDocument(info.bioinfweb.jtreess.document.Document, ApplicationDataProvider)}.
